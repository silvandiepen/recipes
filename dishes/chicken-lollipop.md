# Chicken Lollipops

Yeva always makes fun of me when I make it, the name makes here crinch but the result she loves. It's a little bit of work, but the result is worth it. 

Get your chicken legs and get cut around the top of the bone, in this way you cut through the parts which keep the leg together and you can push the meat down. This way you can have your chicken leg rounded up on the bottom and make them sit/stand in an oven tray. Spice the chicken up with the ingredients below and leave it marinating for a few hours. All you have to do is put them in them in the over on grill for a bit and you are done.

- [ ] chicken legs
- [ ] ketjap manis
- [ ] Salt
- [ ] pinch of rosemary
- [ ] Paprika powder
- [ ] Garlic powder
- [ ] Ketchup
- [ ] Ground cumin
- [ ] Ground coriander
