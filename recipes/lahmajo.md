# Lahmajo

Lahmajo, or also.. "Armenian Pizza", a dish which has its arabic origins. I love it and it's hard to get here, or made with lamb, which Yeva is not a big fan of. That's why I just started to make it myself, over and over again trying to perfect it. 

No exact measurements, because I just do something, whatever I feel right about.

### The dough;

Prepare the dough preferably a day up front. Let it rest and raise in the fridge (or outside, depends how hot it is outside).

- [ ] All purpose flower
- [ ] Warm(ish) water
- [ ] Yeast
- [ ] Salt
- [ ] Pinch of sugar
- [ ] Olive oil 

### The meat;

Prepare the meat a few hours upfront so the spices can get through the meat nicely.

- [ ] Fresh grounded minced beef
- [ ] canned tomato puree
- [ ] Gloves of minced garlic
- [ ] Finely chopped onions
- [ ] fresh(!) parsley
- [ ] fresh Grounded black pepper
- [ ] Cumin
- [ ] Paprika powder
- [ ] Smoked paprika powder
